# DESCRIPTION:
The Neural Style Transfer (NST) Model is an advanced deep learning technique that applies artistic styles to photographs. This project uses PyTorch and a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another.
The model extracts content features from a given image and style features from an artwork, then optimizes a target image to match both. The technique is widely used in digital art, creative design, and AI-based image enhancement. By leveraging pre-trained VGG19 from TorchVision, the system effectively captures both style and content, allowing users to generate visually stunning, stylized images.
This implementation uses:
PyTorch for deep learning computations
Torchvision models (e.g., VGG19) for feature extraction
Pillow & Matplotlib for image processing and visualization
This AI-powered artistic transformation enables users to convert ordinary images into creative artwork, making it an exciting application of deep learning in digital art and design.
